##Description
Before I begin I want to state that nothing within this approachg is considered unethical by any means. 
By using enumeration and finding correlations, I was able to determine some best practices when it comes to
promoting anything within the algorithims that are already in place in the google search web engine. Below 
I outline a few key takeways and tips for anyone looking to gain a edge with their e-commerce presence.

##pre-required steps

1. Firstly of course Identify the target geo locations you want google to present your page first on. 
Use web analytics tools to determine the locations with high user traffic for the desired business.
Prioritize regions where the competition is weaker or less established.

2. Optimize Website Content:
Implement keywords and phrases related to the business and the targeted locations within the website's content.
Ensure that the site's meta tags and descriptions emphasize its relevance to the chosen geographic areas.

3. Geo-Targeted Backlinking:
Acquire backlinks from websites based in the targeted regions, preferably those with authority.
Use anchor text containing location-specific keywords to enhance local relevance.

4. Local Business Listings:
Submit the business to local directories and review platforms, ensuring consistency in business information.
Encourage positive reviews from users in the target areas to boost local credibility.

5. Sitemap Optimization:
Create a detailed XML sitemap that prioritizes content relevant to the chosen geographic locations.
Submit the updated sitemap to Google Search Console to facilitate efficient crawling.

6. Dynamic Content Delivery:
Implement dynamic content delivery based on the user's IP address to tailor the experience to their location.
This may include displaying location-specific promotions or information.

7. Utilize Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP):
Develop AMP versions of critical pages to enhance loading speed, especially for mobile users.
Faster loading times contribute positively to search rankings.
